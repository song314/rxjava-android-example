RxJava Android Example
======================

A proof-of-concept implementation of [FRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) in Android. It uses [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava) and some sugar to connect Android components to `Observable`s.

The idea is to improve RxJava to be used like
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) is used for iOS/OS X. I intent to use this project as a laboratory for experimenting with APIs and implementation as still serve as some living example of the pattern applied to the Android world.

Take a look into
[ComposeMessageActivity](app/src/main/java/com/example/rx/ComposeMessageActivity.java) for more details.
